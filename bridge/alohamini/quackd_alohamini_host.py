"""quackd's AlohaMini host: upstream's own host, with the arms switched on.

Run this on the robot instead of `python -m lerobot.robots.alohamini.alohamini_host`. It is
upstream's host loop, unmodified, with three things done around it:

1. **Arm torque is enabled after connect.** Upstream's `configure()` disables torque on both
   arm buses and both of its `enable_torque()` calls are commented out, so a stock robot's
   arms are limp: a joint command moves nothing and a stop cannot hold. Nothing else in the
   driver turns it back on.
2. **The lift is stopped once, immediately.** `home()` runs during connect, drives the lift
   down at full speed, and the write that would zero that register afterwards is commented
   out. Until something writes a zero, the lift is still travelling.
3. **Every observation says so**, with three `quackd_` fields. quackd refuses the arm verbs
   unless it can see them, which is how a stock host is told apart from this one.

This file must never import quackd: quackd's dependencies do not belong on a robot. It ships
in the sdist and never in the wheel. It is plain standard library plus whatever upstream
already needed, and the two functions that do the work take any object with the right
attributes, so they are tested with fakes and no robot.

Requires upstream installed on the robot:
    git clone https://github.com/liyiteng/lerobot_alohamini
    cd lerobot_alohamini && pip install -e ".[all]"
    python quackd_alohamini_host.py --robot_model alohamini2
