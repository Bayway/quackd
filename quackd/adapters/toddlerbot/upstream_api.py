"""The only file in quackd allowed to spell a ToddlerBot name (ADR-0028).

Every constant is tagged VERIFIED (read from upstream source, link given) or UNVERIFIED (an
assumption of ours, with what quackd does about it). `docs/adapters/toddlerbot.md` is the
human-readable version; `tests/test_upstream_api.py` proves UNVERIFIED names are only
reachable from the experimental `bridge` backend.

Source of truth: https://github.com/hshi74/toddlerbot at commit
84e02d14261292eec5d06f896e3145b35c54856c, which is what the annotated tag `v2.0.0` points at
(read 2026-09-05). The tag object's own sha is 6fde5df5 and is NOT a commit: pinning that gets
a 422 from the API.

This robot has no network API of any kind: no socket, no daemon, no IPC. It is a Python
library whose control loop opens serial ports in-process. So quackd ships a daemon, as it does
for the Open Duck Mini, and this file is what that daemon is written against.

Two facts about the pin itself, before anything else. `pyproject.toml` calls this version
0.2.0 while the tag says v2.0.0, and CI is disabled: the workflow echoes a skip and exits 0.
Nothing here was ever machine-verified by upstream.

Nothing here has been run against a ToddlerBot.
