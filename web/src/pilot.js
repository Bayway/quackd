/**
 * quackd, in about two hundred lines: the loop, the verbs and the contract.
 *
 * This is the browser's version of `quackd/agent/loop.py`, `quackd/verbs/core.py` and
 * `quackd/safety.py`, kept deliberately small so the whole idea fits on one screen. The
 * model never sees a joint, a motor or a pixel. It sees a list of verbs the robot's own
 * manifest declares, one observation per turn, and a contract: which verbs are allowed,
 * how many steps it gets, and how long. It answers with exactly one verb per turn. The
 * executor checks that verb against the contract before the robot moves, and the run stops
 * when the budget is spent whatever the model thinks.
 *
 * The `Runtime` underneath owns the 50 Hz clock. Verbs ask it for simulated seconds; it
 * paces those against the wall clock so the page shows real time and a recording plays
 * back at the speed it happened.

that rolls when it is kicked, and a purple person marker. Distances are metres.
