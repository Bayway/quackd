"""Serve this directory the way production does: mounted at /simulator/, not at the root.

The page is deployed under www.quackd.org/simulator, so every reference in index.html is
absolute — `/simulator/style.css`, not `style.css`. Relative paths cannot survive that mount:
quackd-web sets `trailingSlash: false`, so the browser lands on `/simulator` with no slash and
resolves a relative `style.css` to `/style.css`, which is the landing page's root and not this
directory at all.

The cost of absolute paths is that a plain `http.server --directory web` no longer works, since
nothing answers on /simulator. This is that missing piece: one stdlib server, no dependencies,
serving web/ under the same prefix the deploy uses, so what you test is what ships.

    python web/serve.py [port]        # then open http://localhost:8000/simulator/
