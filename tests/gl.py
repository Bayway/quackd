"""Make an offscreen OpenGL context, or skip saying why.

Every rendering test in the physics suite needs one, and a bare CI runner has no GPU, no
display and no `/dev/dri`. Skipping is right on a developer's machine. It is wrong in the job
that exists to run these: a missing system library would turn that job green having proved
nothing, which is the state it was added to end. `QUACKD_REQUIRE_GL=1` turns the skip into a
failure, and the exception text goes into the skip reason either way, so a real renderer
regression names itself instead of disappearing.
